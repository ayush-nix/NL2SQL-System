"""
Confidence-Based Query Router — Adaptive Pipeline Routing

Instead of running every query through the full 7-layer pipeline,
this module classifies query complexity and routes:

  - SIMPLE queries  → Skip Schema Linking, go straight to generation (faster)
  - MODERATE queries → Full pipeline (standard)
  - COMPLEX queries  → Full pipeline + extra context + larger model context window

Reference: AgenticSQL (2025) — adaptive routing reduces latency by 40%
on simple queries while preserving accuracy on complex ones.

SECURITY: This module only classifies. No destructive operations.
